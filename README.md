# DESIGN-THINKING-PROJECT

During this semester, I worked on a Design Thinking project as part of my Technology System and Information course. This project focused on creating an innovative solution to improve employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities.

Me and my groupmates developed an application called JobEquality, designed to bridge the gap between job seekers with disabilities and companies looking for capable employees. The app helps individuals with disabilities find job opportunities that align with their skills and needs, while also enabling companies to discover qualified candidates who may otherwise face barriers in the hiring process.
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into:

User-Centered Design & Accessibility – Ensuring the app is inclusive and user-friendly
Technology for Social Impact – Using tech to solve real-world challenges
Problem-Solving & Innovation – Applying Design Thinking principles to create meaningful solutions
Application Development Process – From ideation to prototyping and potential implementation
This experience reinforced the importance of accessibility, inclusivity, and technology-driven solutions in shaping a better future for job seekers with disabilities.
