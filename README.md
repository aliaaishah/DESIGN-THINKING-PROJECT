# DESIGN THINKING PROJECT

## 📌 Overview 
During this semester, I worked on a Design Thinking project as part of my Technology System and Information course. This project focused on creating an innovative solution to improve employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities.

Me and my groupmates developed an application called JobEquality, designed to bridge the gap between job seekers with disabilities and companies looking for capable employees. The app helps individuals with disabilities find job opportunities that align with their skills and needs, while also enabling companies to discover qualified candidates who may otherwise face barriers in the hiring process.

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into:
1. **User-Centered Design & Accessibility** – Ensuring the app is inclusive and user-friendly.  

2. **Technology for Social Impact** – Using tech to solve real-world challenges.  

3. **Problem-Solving & Innovation** – Applying Design Thinking principles to create meaningful solutions.  

4. **Application Development Process** – From ideation to prototyping and potential implementation.  

5. **This experience reinforced the importance of accessibility, inclusivity, and technology-driven solutions in shaping a better future for job seekers with disabilities.**

## 💡 Reflections & Learnings  
Developing JobEquality, a job-finding app for people with disabilities, has been an eye-opening and transformative experience for our team. This project taught us how to break down complex problems into manageable steps and approach problem-solving systematically. Through research and direct engagement with individuals facing these challenges, we gained valuable insights, strengthening our communication skills and deepening our understanding of accessibility and inclusivity.

Collaboration played a crucial role in our journey. By combining our diverse skills and perspectives, we crafted a solution tailored to the unique needs of our users. This process enhanced our critical thinking, creativity, and teamwork, reinforcing the importance of working together towards a meaningful goal.

Beyond technical skills, this project instilled in us a sense of purpose—to leverage technology for positive social impact. It has inspired us to continue innovating, refining our problem-solving abilities, and staying committed to creating solutions that make a real difference in people's lives.
